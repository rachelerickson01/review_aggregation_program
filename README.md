# Review Aggregation Web-Scraping Program

This capstone project is a webscraping tool that gathers reviews for a given restaurant from multiple online platforms and uses machine learning to extract insights. The tool aggregates customer feedback from major platforms in one place, providing a comprehensive view of customer sentiment and experience. Rather than manually checking multiple review sites, the user can utilize this tool to centralize reviews in one interface, saving time and enabling data-driven decisions.
